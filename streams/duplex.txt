- Working with Node.js streams

Introduction
Streams are one of the major features that most Node.js applications rely on, especially when handling HTTP requests, reading/writing files, and making socket communications. Streams are very predictable since we can always expect data, error, and end events when using streams.

# types of streams
   - Readable streams: The readable stream is responsible for reading data from a source file 
   - Writable streams: The writable stream is responsible for writing data in specific formats to files
   - Duplex streams: Duplex streams are streams that implement both readable and writable stream interfaces
   - Transform streams: The transform stream is a type of duplex stream that reads data, transforms the data, and then writes the  transformed data in a specified format
